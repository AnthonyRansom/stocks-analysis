in the dataset.


## Results

### Stock Performance Results
Looking at the results of the analyis for the [2017](/Resources/VBA_Challenge_Stocks_2017.png) and [2018](/Resources/VBA_Challenge_Stocks_2018.png) year indicates a decline in the stocks in 2018.
the 2017 year showed a good majority in stock prices but the 2018 yeat showed a decline in most of the stocks.

The "ENPH" and "RUN" stocks performed well over both the 2017 and 2018 years showing a positive return for both years.
the DQ stock whcih Steve's parents invested in showed a very good 199.4% return in the 2017 year but unfortunately the 2018
year resulted in a 62.6% loss. This loss did not result in Steve's parents losing thier initial investment but has caused a delay
in the long term investment growth.
